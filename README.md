A simple mock Google home page. Created as the first Odin Project project. At the moment I feel unprepared to handle a project as simple as this even with all the practice and reading the Odin Project has provided, but I won't let that stop me from trying. 

After finishing, I found the most enjoyable thing for me was when I could finally find the solution to a problem I would encounter. The relief and feeling of "finally! I did it!" unexpectedly felt amazing. I learned how to use flex box, adding id's and classes, linking images, useful extensions (like spell check extension and auto rename tag extension.) 

What I can do better at: Learning more about flex box, and media query's.
